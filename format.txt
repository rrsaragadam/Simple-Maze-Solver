A maze is made up of 4 different characters (5 including newlines)

'X' - A Wall
' ' - A passage
'S' - The start point
'X' - An exit

In a valid maze:

* Each line will have the same number of characters (the width of the maze)
* Each line will end with a newline character (if that matters)
* Start and exit tiles will have a wall beside them
* The maze is surrounded by wall and exit tiles
  * In other words, the only gaps in the OUTER wall are exits.
  * This means it is not possible to leave the bounds of the maze without
    hitting an exit
  * This does NOT mean the outer wall is a rectangle!

The following is a valid maze:

XXXXX
X  SX
XX XX
 X X
 X X
 X X
 XEX
